# Introduction
First review of the code to calculate phylogenetic diversity (PD) for biodiversity data cubes. The plan is to create an R package after resolving the last open issues.

The phylogenetic indicator software is available in the [pdindicatoR](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/pdindicatoR) GitHub repository.
The repository was forked to [here](https://github.com/wlangera/pdindicatoR) from this reference point:

https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/pdindicatoR/commit/f380d6cda82351d3bd83599e63591b9005c344ba

# Remarks

`workflow.R` is the main script.

## Current code

- Use relative paths (https://docs.b-cubed.eu/dev-guide/#r-rproj)

For example, the following code does not run since it is not relative to the R project

```r
# Load config file
source("config.R")

# Load functions
source("./taxonmatch.R")
```

- The data was not provided so `workflow.R` could not be executed

- Coding style (https://docs.b-cubed.eu/dev-guide/#r-style)
  - Try to follow the [tidyverse style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) guide as requested by the software develoment guide
  - This will benefit code clarity for collaboration now and in the future (most important for future self)


## R package development

- Should there be 2 repositories?

Currently there are workflow test scripts and functions and datafiles etc. present in the repository.
It might be beneficial to start with a single clean repo for the R package to maintain a clear overview, and a separate repo with test scripts of the analysis workflows. One or some of these workflows could be useful as a vignette/article in R package repo later on.

- Perhaps some functions should be renamed (https://docs.b-cubed.eu/dev-guide/#r-function-naming)
  - "Use verbs to name functions whenever possible"
  - Currently, everything is called PD indicator, but in the future more PD indicators might be added. If I understand correctly, there is only 1 indicator calculated at the moment (i.e., sum of branch lengths).

- In the package, we should not have the tidyverse dependency since this contains a lot of packages. Instead use the ones we actually need (dplyr, stringr ...).
  
## General

The structure of the PD indicator is not entirely clear to me.

**1.** There could be multiple PD indicators, e.g.:

- `calc_pd_ind1(cube, tree)`: e.g. sum of branch lengths (currently in `calculate_pd()`)
- `calc_pd_ind2(cube, tree)`: ...
- `calc_pd_ind3(cube, tree)`: ...
- ...

**2.** There could be multiple derived PD indicators. The `f` argument is one of the PD indicator functions above, e.g.:

- `calc_derived_pd_ind1(cube, f, cutoff)`: e.g. the percentage of high PD cells that fall within the boundaries of a protected area (currently in `pdindicator()`)
- ...

Currently, everything is called PD indicator. The functions should get clear names of what they do. E.g. `calc_sum_branchlength_pdind()` instead of `calculate_pd()` and `calc_protected_area_pdind()` instead of `pdindicator()` (maybe some shorter names?).
