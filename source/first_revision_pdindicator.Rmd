# Introduction
First review of the code to calculate phylogenetic diversity (PD) for biodiversity data cubes. The plan is to create an R package after resolving the last open issues.

The phylogenetic indicator software is available in the [pdindicatoR](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/pdindicatoR) GitHub repository.
The repository was forked to [here](https://github.com/wlangera/pdindicatoR) from this reference point:

https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/pdindicatoR/commit/f380d6cda82351d3bd83599e63591b9005c344ba

# Remarks

- Should there be 2 repositories?

Currently there are workflow test scripts and functions and datafiles etc. present in the repository.
It might be beneficial to start with a single clean repo for the R package to maintain a clear overview, and a separate repo with test scripts of the analysis workflows. One or some of these workflows could be useful as a vignette/article in R package repo later on.
